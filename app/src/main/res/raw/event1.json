        "description": " The coach for this Fishbowl is Simon Brown, a remarkable leader himself who is now a highly-regarded coach for senior leaders in search of transformation, wisdom and fresh perspective. As well as his wealth of executive management experience, clients treasure his unassuming, non-judgemental way of asking deep and pertinent questions that help them bridge the gap between performance and potential. Simon cites a stimulating range of influences, from Ken Blanchard’s Situational Leadership to Barry Oshry’s Seeing Systems, Nancy Kline’s Thinking Environment and Patrick Lencioni’s models of high performing teams. Meyler Campbell coaches may be familiar with an eclectic approach, but how many other coaches have learned from Native American Indian leaders? Simon credits his time spent with the Ojibwa Tribe as gifting him energy, calm and wisdom – as well as the name for his coaching practice, Lead Eagle. Notwithstanding his incredible depth of knowledge and experience, Simon has a quiet, humble and curiosity-driven style that liberates his clients’ own thinking, learning and problem-solving. Simon’s business background speaks for itself. As a Vice President of Microsoft, he led large organisations, delivered on $1bn sales budgets and had a track record of leading successful change projects at country, regional and global level. Prior to joining Microsoft in 1993, Simon was at IBM for 10 years, mainly in high end enterprise sales roles. He has always put energy and care into building leadership teams, growing talent and diversity and served as Executive Sponsor for Diversity in Microsoft&#39;s EMEA region. Simon is currently Chairman of the Board of Redgate Software, 3T Software Labs, Gearset, and F-LEX. He is also a marathon running yachtsman who loves mountain walking, golf, reading a good novel, and fine wine.  This Fishbowl could go in any direction: make sure you’re there to watch it unfold! If you&#39;d like to book on this event using your elective hours please contact sophieford@meylercampbell.com  ",
